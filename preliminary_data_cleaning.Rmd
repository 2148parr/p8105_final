## Importing NHATS data and selecting only relevant variables

Using only round 5 data, included ID variable, the two variables needed for the depression risk scale (PHQ-2), gender, age, race, whether participant uses mobility devices, size of social network, whether or not they have no one to talk to, self reported memory issues causing problems, if dementia is reason for a proxy (note this variable is only relevant for people who have a proxy, so we can't omit missing/NA for this variable), self-rated health, and whether they are happy with their living situation. 

```{r nhats}
nhats = read_sas("./final_data/nhats_r5.sas7bdat")  %>%
  select(spid, hc5depresan1, hc5depresan2, r5dgender, r5d2intvrage, rl5dracehisp, md5canewlker, 
         sn5dnumsn, fl5noonetalk, cg5ofmemprob, is5reasnprx1, hc5health, wb5truestme4) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
